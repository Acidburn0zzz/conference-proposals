# Top-Level Awaiting for Godot

## Abstract

It goes without saying that one of the largest challenges in JavaScipt is handling asynchronicity. Along come Async / Await, a language feature made popular by C#. Developers can now use the keyword `await` to write code in a synchronous fashion without blocking the main thread. The only catch is that the `await` keyword needs to be used in an `async` function.

What if that were not the case? What if `await` could be used anywhere inside a JavaScript module? This talk follows the adventure of implementing the Top-Level await feature in the JavaScript language. From deep dives into module loading to a high level overview of socializing standards changes, this talk covers the process of what it takes to change the JavaScript language.
