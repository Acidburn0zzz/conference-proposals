# Why Empathy Matters

## Abstract

Empathy can be a pivotal factor in the success of yourself and your projects.
If you don't care about the people using your product, why are you making it?
If you don't care about your co-workers who will have to use your code, why do
you work with them? If you don't care about yourself, why are you doing this as
a career?

Some people may ask "why empathy?”. Let’s examine this concept, find ways to be more
empathetic in our actions, and discuss the pragmatism of empathy.

## A bit more info

community, their co-workers, and themselves. The talk will also explore larger ways we
