## A bit more info

ES Modules and Common JS go together like old bay seasoning and vanilla ice cream. This talk will dig into the inconsistencies of the two patterns, and how the Node.js project is dealing with reconciling the problem. The talk will look at the history of modules in the js ecosystem and the subtle difference between them. It will also skim over how ecma-262 is standardized, and how esmodules were developed
