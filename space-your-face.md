# Space your face: spatialized audio for fun and profit

## Abstract

How does the human brain know where a sound is placed? How can we use that
information to hack the brain into thinking recorded sound is coming from
a certain place? OMG you can do this with the browser? All this and more
when Myles Borins SPACES YOUR FACE

## A bit more info

This talk involves a demo of spatializing audio using the browser and headphones.
In a local meetup this was done by requesting people to bring headphones and handing
out around 10 pairs of cheap headphones for people to use.

If the room where this talk is being given has multiple channels of speakers we
can arrange a much more intensive demo using ambisonics and other open technologies.

## Pitch

How the brain places sound in space is incredibly interesting. Once you can codify this phenomenon it is possible to use computer and hardware to encode and emulate sounds in physical space.

VIRTUAL REALITY SOUND!!!!

I'm really excited about this as you can tell.

I studied music technology in graduate school and did a course on spatial audio. This included both programming software to place sound in space and using that software to write compositions. I'd really love to share this knowledge with folks.

## Watch the talk

An early iteration of this talk was given at BrooklynJS in Dec of 2016

Invite me to your event to further expand on it.
