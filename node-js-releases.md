# Node.js Releases, how do they work?

## Abstract

Node.js is growing up, and with that comes the responsibility of proper legacy
support. As of Node.js Argon (v4.2.0) there is an official Long Term Support
release cycle that lasts for 30 months!

How does a project moving at the pace of node maintain multiple release lines?
How does a commit get backported? How is a release actually made?

You will learn all this and more on this weeks episode of
"Node.js Releases, how do they work?".

## A bit more info

I work as a full time Node.js contributor for IBM. Currently I am one of the
individuals in the trenches back porting commits. If you are using an LTS version
of node, there is a decent likely hood that I released it.

Release management is a very interesting art, and I would love the opportunity to
pull the curtains back a bit on the process of how code lands into a project like
node, and the kind of edge cases created when wrangling such a repo.
